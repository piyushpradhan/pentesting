# Compute Fundamentals of AWS
## Compute in AWS
- Functionality is similar to CPU and RAM
> A physical server within a data center would be considered a Compute resource as it may have multiple CPU's and many Gigabytes of RAM

#### Services provided
1.  Multiple EC2 instances(virtual servers) which may be used continuously for a long period of time
2. Execute a few lines of code within AWS lamba within a few hundred milliseconds
##  Elastic Compute Cloud
- Deploy virtual servers within AWS environment. 
#### Elements of EC2:
- Amazon Machine Images(AMIs) - pre configured EC2 instances(OS + applications + custom configurations)
- Instance types - Size of instance from various parameters
	- ECUs - EC2 Compute Units
	- **vCPUs** - Virtual CPU
	- Clock speed - Clock speed in GHz
	- **Memory** - amount of memory associated
	- **Instance storage**
	- EBS Optimized storage
	- **Network Performance** - speed of data transfer
	- IPv6 support - determines if the instance type supports IPv6 or not
	- Processor Architecture 
	- AESNI - advanced encryption standard new instructions, shows if instance support enhanced data protection
	- AVX - audio/video, 3-D modelling analysis, scientific calculations
	- Turbo -  if instance supports AMD turbo core/Intel turbo boost
- Instance Purchasing Options
	- On-Demand instances
		- Can be launched at any time
		- Can be used for as long as needed
		- Flat rate determined on the instance type
		- Typically used for short term instances
		- Fit for testing and development environments
	- Reserved Instances
		- for a set period of time for reduced cost
		- long term, predictable workloads
	- Scheduled instances
		- Reservations on a recurring schedule either daily, weekly or monthly
		- Could be scheduled to run at any set time
		- User will be charged even if the instance is not being used
	- Spot Instances
		- Bid for an unused EC2 compute resources
		- No guarantees for a fixed period of time
		- Large EC2 instances at a very low price
		- Processing data that can be suddenly interrupted
	- On-Demand Capacity Reservations
		- Reserve capacity based on different attributes such as instance type, platform and tenancy within a particular availability zone for any period of time
		- Could be used with reverse instances discount
- Tenancy - relates to what EC2 instance will reside on, it is like a physical server within an AWS Data center
	- Shared Tenancy 
		- launched on any available host with required resources regardless of the other customer's users
		- same host multiple users
		- AWS security mechanisms prevent one EC2 instance accessing another in the same host
	- Dedicated Instances
		- Hosted on hardware that no other customer can access
		- May be required to meet compliance 
		- Incur additional charges
- User Data
	- While configuring EC2 instance, there's an option 'user data'
	- This basically allows you to enter commands that will run during the first boot cycle
- Storage Options
	- Pesistent - available EBS volumes attached, logically attached via AWS network, can be disconnected and reconnected to another instance, encryption and backup available
	- Ephemeral - Temporary - Created be EC2 instances themselves, data is erased after the instance is stopped, volumes are not detachable
- Security
	- Security group - this option is like a firewall which allows control over traffic, what traffic can be allowed to communicate with the instance, restrict communication by source, ports and protocols for both inbound and outbound communications.
	- Key pair is used to authenticate user to log into instances
		- Public key is kept by AWS, private key stays with the user
		- Example: SSH on linux
	- Less privileged accounts could be setup
	- Latest OS and security patches should be updated and installed on a regular basis
