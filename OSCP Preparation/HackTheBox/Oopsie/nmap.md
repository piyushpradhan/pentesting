# nmap

## -sS

- half-opening scanning
- allows nmap to get information from the remote host without a complete TCP handshake process
- nmap sends SYN packets to the destination but doesn't create a session, as a result, no log of the interaction is recorded
- USED BY DEFAULT
- **REQUIRES ROOT/ADMIN PRIVILEGES**

## -sT

- **DEFAULT SCANNIG TECHNIQUE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ROOT PRIVILEGE**
- **only scans for TCP ports**
- completes the three-way TCP handshake, required the system to call connect()

## -sU

- scans for open UDP ports
- no SYN packets

## -sF

- FIN scan sends the packet with a FIN flag which doesn't require a complete handshake

## -sI

- COMPLETE ANONYMITY
- doesn't send packets from original IP Address, instead it uses another target machine as it's host
- Ex - nmap -sI 192.168.1.6 192.168.14.3

## -O

- For detecting the OS of the target machine
