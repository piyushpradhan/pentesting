# DNS Resolution Steps

1. User opens up a domain
2. DNS resolver's responsibility is to fetch the IP address 
3. First local cache is checked for any record of the queried domain
    1. Cache usually contains a mapping of IP Address to hostnames which are saved during recent lookups
4. if nothing is found in cache it queries the DNS server to see if it has a record
5. If still no record is found, it goes through recursive DNS query in which it queries different name servers to get the IP address of the domain
