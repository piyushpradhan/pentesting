# Cryptography
### Encrytion 
- Takes in a plaintext message and converts it into cipher text by running an algorithms on it.
### Decryption
- Converts cipher text to its original form
### Non-repudiation 
- Rejection or denial of something's validity, such as refusing to fulfill a legal contract. 
- Used in infosec to ensure that an individual or organization obligated by contractual obligation cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on the original contract.
- In other words, non-repudiation refers to the mechanisms that prove that the sender sent the message.

## Symmetric Cryptography
- Both sender and receiver share a single key for encryption and decryption
- Examples: 
  - AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 : here 128, 192 and 256 represent the key length in bits to encrypt and decrypt a block of messages.
- Mostly used for transmitting bulk data because its quicker and easier to execute
- Algorithms used: AES, QUAD, RC4, 3DES, DES

## Asymmetric Cryptography
- Public key cryptography, requires two separate keys - one public and one private key.
- The message is encrypted with public key and decrypted with the private key.
- Anyone with the public key can encrypt messages but can't decrypt information.
- The information can only be decrypted by someone who has the corresponding private key.
- Only a viable option for securely exchaning secret keys required for symmetric encryption because it's difficult to do and slow to operate.
- Algorithms used: DSA, RSA, EL GAMAL, ECC, Diffie Hellman

### Examples of asymmetric cryptography
1. Digital Signature Standard (DSS) : Federal Information Processing Standard that provides algorithms for generating digital signatures using the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) for digital document authentication.
2. ElGamal - is a public key method that can be used for encryption as well as digital signing. The encryption algorithm resembles the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol in nature. It employs discrete algorithms and is used in many applications.

### SSL protocol as asymmetric encryption
- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the protocol that secures the HTTP protocol in the application layer to make it HTTPS.


### How does SSL/TLS work ?
1. SSL encrypts data sent across the web.
2. SSL initiates an authetication process known as a handshake between two communicating devices to ensure that both devices are who they claim to be.
3. SSL also digitally signs data to ensure data integrity, ensuring that it reaches its intended recipient untampered.

**SSL employs both symmetric and asymmetric encryption**
- Asymmetric encryption is used to create a secure session between a server and a client.
- Symmetric encryption transfers information without the secure session.
