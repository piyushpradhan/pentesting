## Initial access

Found password for "root" inside BlockyCore/myfirstplugin

used these credentials to log into myphpadmin

from the dashboard I found credentials to a wordpress user â†’ notch 

used his password hash to log into ssh 

sudo -l revealed that notch could run every command with sude permissions, used vim to acquire root shell
