Found the password to `djmardov` in pass.txt file

the text in .backup file was passphrase to extract pass.txt from the image present on the website

Found a vulnerable SUID/SGID executable

That didn't work

Tried exploiting another SUID executable, `viewuser` which executes a /tmp/listusers script, so I put my own malicious script in /tmp/listusers to run /bin/sh as root

root shell obtained!
