# Instance Creation
An instance in AWS is an EBS-backed instance, i.e. the root volume is an EBS volume which is a durable block-level storage device that can be attached to AWS instances and can be used as a physical hard drive. 
An deployed instance can be secured by specifying a key pair and a security group for inbound and outbound traffic which determines user access (acts as a firewall).
