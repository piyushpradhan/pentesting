# Firewall evasion 

## Useful switches 
1. -f : used to fragment the packets making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS
2. --mtu <number> : alternative of "-f" that provides more control over the size of the packets. 
    - It accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent.
    - *Must be a multiple of 8*. 
3. --scan-delay <time>ms : used to add a delay between packets sent. 
    - useful if the network is unstable. 
    - helpful for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
4. --badsum : used to generate invalid checksum for packets. 
    - Real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet. 
    - Firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. 
    - It can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.
