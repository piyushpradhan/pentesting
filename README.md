# Networking basics

## OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

- Standardised model used to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking.
- More compact version of TCP/IP model

Layers in OSI Model

1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

### 7. Application

- Provides networking optioons to programs
- Works exclusively with applications to provide them with an interface to transmit data
- Data is passed down to the Presentation Layer

### 6. Presentation

- Data it receives from the application layer is usually in a format that application understands, but it's not 
necessarily a format that can be understood by the application layer on the receiving computer. 
- Presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format and also handles any encryption, compression or 
any other transformations required. 

### 5. Session 
- Checks if a connection can be setup with another computer across the network or not 
- If it can't then it throws an error an the process goes no further
- If it can then it's the job of the session layer to maintain it, as well as co-operate with the session layer of the
remote computer in order to synchronise communications. 
- The session it creates is unique to the communication in question. 
- This allows us to make multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all the data geting mixed up.
- After successfully establishing a connection between the remote and host computer the data is passed down to the 
transport layer. 

### 4. Transport 
- First, chooses a protocol over which data is to be transmitted. 
- Most common protocols 
	- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
		- Transmission is connection-based, which means the connection is established and maintained for the duration of 
		request.
		- Computers remain in constant communication 
		- Data is sent at an acceptable speed
		- Lost data is re-sent 
	- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		- There's not guarantee data will be received properly
	- TCP will be chosen for situations where accuracy is favoured over speed (e.g File transfer, loading a webpage)
	- UDP will be used in situations where speed is more important (e.g video streaming)

- After selecting the protocol transport layer divides the transmission into bite-sized pieces
	- Over TCP these are called segment.
	- Over UDP these are called datagrams. 

### 3. Network 
- Responsible for locating the location of the request. 
- works with local addressing (IP Address)

### 2. Data Link
- Focuses on physical addressing of the transmission. 
- Receives a packet from the network layer and adds it in the physical(MAC) address of the receiving point.  
- Network Interface Card - Unique MAC Address
- When information is sent across a network, physical address (MAC address) is used to identify the source
- Presents the data in a format suitable for transmission. 
- Checks if the data has been corrupted during the transmission. 

### 1. Physical 
- Electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. 
- Converts the binary data of the transmission into signals and pass them across the network
- Receives signals converts them back to binary data. 


## TCP/IP Model
- Consists of four layers 
	- Application 
	- Transport 
	- Internet 
	- Network Interface
- At each layer of the TCP/IP model a header is added during encapsulation and removed during de-encapsulation.
