Finding the subdomain that contains amazon s3 bucket for `flaws.cloud`

## Finding public aws s3 bucket using Google Dorking

`site:s3.amazonaws.com flaws.cloud`
The first link was the desired subdomain: flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com

- Found this in the XML file of the hosted s3 bucket
  !()['../Images/Pasted image 20220409103852.png']

- The robots.txt file
  ![[Pasted image 20220409103932.png]]
  That wasn't the hint (^\_\^;)

- This was...
  ![[Pasted image 20220409104117.png]]
- index.html, quite obviously pointed to the landing page of `flaws.cloud`

### Note:

Probably all S3 buckets have this general structure of URL.
"domain.s3.amazonaws.com"

What actually happened was, first the user made that s3 bucket, containing those static files for this website public, which was fine but then he/she modified the bucket policy to allow everybody "s3:GetObject" privileges. So now everyone can head over to "flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com" and list all the files in that bucket.
