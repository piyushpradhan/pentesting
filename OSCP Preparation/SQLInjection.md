# SQL Injection

## UNION Attacks
- UNION keyword allows us to execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. 
- Ex: 
  ```
  SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
  ```
  This query will return a single result set with two columns containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.

- Requirements: 
  - The individual queries must be similar, they must return the same number of columns
  - The data types in each column must be compatible between individual queries

## By passing common filters
### Avoiding blocked characters
Case 1: Quotes are prohibited
  - Single quotes aren't required if injection is performed into a numeric data field or column name. 
  - If a string value is being passed, 
  ```
  SELECT username FROM users WHERE isadmin = 2 union select name from sqlol.ssn where name='herp derper'--
  ```
  is equivalent to: 
  ```
  SELECT username FROM users WHERE isadmin = 2 union select name from sqlol.ssn where name=0x4865727020446572706572--
  ```

Case 2: Comment symbols are blocked 
  - Write queries carefully, to not break the syntax of the surrounding query. 
  - Use alternative symbols to comment, ex: #

Case 3: Whitespace is blocked
  - Comments or application blocks can be used to simulate white space 
  - Ex: 
  ```
  0 or 1
  0/**/or/**/1
  ```

Case 4: Keywords or other words are validated
  - For example, if the SELECT keyword is being blocked or removed, you can try the following bypasses:
  ```SeLeCt %00SELECT SELSELECTECT %53%45%4c%45%43%54 %2553%2545%254c%2545%2543%2554```
