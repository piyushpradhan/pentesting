# Picke Rick - TryHackMe machine

# Enumeration

nmap scan to find open port 

- found ssh and http ports open
- enumerated http port → running on Apache 2.4.18

extracted username from page source → R1ckRul3s

possible approaches 

- using SQL injection to login
- password spraying
- OR WE CAN JUST FIND A PASSWORD FROM ROBOTS.TXT which we found with dirb

easy login to the website with the credentials I found earlier 

Command shell, somehow get a reverse shell

- The bash reverse shell isn't working
- trying my luck with Perl reverse shell (didn't work)

So I didn't have to gain access to the shell, I could view the contents of any file using "less" command

Found the first and second ingredients from files lying around in the file system

The "cd" command wasn't working for some reason, so I just had to search using ls and also "sudo -l" revealed that we don't have to provide any password for running root commands.

The cat command wasn't working not even with sudo, I guess I just have to get the reverse shell to use the cat command. I found an alternative so I won't be wasting time on that.

the final flag was inside of the /root/ directory
