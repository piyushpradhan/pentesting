## ping 
- To check if connection to a remote resource is possible. 
- Usually the target is a website but it can also be a computer on your home network, to check if it is configured
correctly
- works on ICMP protocol (slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocol), works on the network layer of the OSI model 
or the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.

## traceroute 
- Diplays the path your request takes to reach the destination 
- On Windows *tracert* follows ICMP protocol same as that of ping, but on UNIX it follow UDP which can be changed
using switches on both Windows and UNIX.
