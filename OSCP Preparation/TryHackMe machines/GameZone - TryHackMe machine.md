## Enumeration

nmap scans reveal that port 80 and 22 are open 

The web server has a login form that makes SQL queries to authenticate users 

Tried to use admin and ' or 1=1 — - to login, but it didn't work, apparently the database didn't have an user "admin" 

So I tried to login using ' or 1=1 — - as username and empty password

redirected to the portal.php page
