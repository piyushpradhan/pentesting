# Hashing
- It's a method of transforming file information into a string
- Hashing converts this chunks of data (file) into a much shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.
- Unidirectional process, recontruction of data is not possible.

## MD5
- Encodes a string of information into a 128-bit fingerprint.
- not secure for widespread use - easy to crack

## SHA
- Extremely secure
- Higher the number after the "SHA" the newer it is and more complex the software.

## Use in forensics
- Hashing functions ensures the forensic team that the digital evidence that has been copied and checked is identical to the original.
