## Metadata
Data related information used for indexing and storage
essentially data about other data
	- title
	- description
	- creator's name
	- date of creation
	- date of modification
	- file's permissions

### Tools
- Exiftool

## Steganography 
- Technique for hiding files within other files 

### Image files
- images are most common but audio files are also used 

- Examples: Least Significant Bits (LSB)

### Audio files
- One way is to synthesize an image into sound ind viewing its audio file's spectogram

### Extracing data in office documents
- 2nd generation office documents like DOCX, PPTX, *X are actually zip archives
- change the extension to .zip and unzip them

# Deleting data
- When a file is deleted, OS does not actually wipe the data but rather removes the file's metadata from the file table in that partition
	- filetable - all the records of files in a partition
- The data is there, but its identification and location is lost.
- It is possible to recover deleted data by scanning the drive for file type identifiers(file headers) and then restoring them

## Deleting vs Wiping 
- Unlike in deleting, in wiping the space originally taken by the file is overwritten with junk and random values to prevent recovery, removes all file signatures making it irrecoverable
	- Tools : TestDisk & PhotoRec
- To completely wipe data : rewrite the same location with new files
