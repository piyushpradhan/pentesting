# XSS

### Types of XSS
**1. Stored XSS (Persistent)**
	- Occurs when user input is stored on the target server, like a database, message forum, visitor log, comment field etc. and the victim is able to retrieve stored data from the web. 
**2. Reflected XSS (Non-persistent)**
	- Occurs when user input is immediately returned by web application in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input provided by the user as part of the request, without that data being made safe to render in the browser and without permanently storing the user provided data.
**3. DOM Based XSS**
	- source of data is in DOM and the sink is also in the DOM and the data flow never leaves the browser. 
	- Ex: the source could be the URL of the page or it could be an HTML element and the sink is a sensitive method call that causes the execution of the malicious data from the source. (ex:- document.write)
**4. Server XSS**
	- Occurs when untrusted user supplied data is included in an HTTP response generated by the server. 
	- The source could be from the request, or from a stored location.

**5. Client XSS** 
	- Occurs when untrusted user supplied data is used to update the DOM with an unsafe Javascript call. 
	- A Javascript call is considered unsafe if it can be used to introduce valid Javascript into the DOM.
	- This source of data could have been sent by the server or from the DOM.
