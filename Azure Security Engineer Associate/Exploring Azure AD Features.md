# Difference between Azure AD and AD Domain services
![[Pasted image 20220321191813.png]]
- Azure AD is different from deploying an AD domain controller on an Azure virtual machine and adding it to an on-premises domain
### Identity Solution
Azure AD is primarily an identity solution, and it is designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP and HTTPS communications
### REST API querying
Because Azure AD is HTTP/HTTPS-based, it **can't be queried through LDAP**. Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP/HTTPS.
### Communication Protocols
- It doesn't use Kerberos Authentication. 
- Uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols like SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication (and OAuth for authorization)
	#### SAML
	- Security Assertion Markup Languages is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (SP). In other words, **one can use a single set of credentials to log into many different websites**.
	- It much simpler to manage one login per user than to manage separate logins to email, customer relationship management software, AD etc.
	- SAML transactions use XML to communicate with service providers. 
	- Simplifies federated authentication and authorization processes for users, identity providers and service providers.
	- **Centralizes user management and provides access to SaaS solutions**
	- SAML authorization tells the service provider what access to grant the authenticated user.
	#### WS-Federation
	- It is a protocol that allows a user to access resources and services on multiple security domains or networks as long as a trust relationship is established.

### Authentication Services
Includes SAML, WS-Federation, or OpenID
### Authorization Service
Uses OAuth
### Federation services
Azure AD includes federation services and many third party services
### Flat Structure
Azure AD Users and Groups are created in a flat structure and there are not Organizational Units or Group Policy Objects, like in AD.

Query via REST APIs                                           Uses Kerberos for authentication

Uses SAML, WS-Federation, or OpenID for authentication - No federated services

Uses OAuth for authorization                             Organizational Units (OUs)
