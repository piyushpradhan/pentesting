# Level 2
For this challenge, use aws cli to list the contents of the s3 bucket (url of the level 2)
```bash
aws s3 --profile <profile-name> ls s3://http://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud
```
For some reason, this didn't work for me (RequestTimeSkewed). Maybe a connection couldn't be established.

### Notes: 
Similar to giving everyone "s3:GetObject" privilege, sometimes user allow "Any authenticated" aws user to list the contents of s3 bucket. 
Which is why this level had to be completed from aws cli, which requires an authenticated aws user. 

To fix the issue mentioned above follow these steps: 
- Install 'ntp' to sync time with aws 
- open /etc/ntp.conf and add these lines at the end 
```
server 0.amazon.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.amazon.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.amazon.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.amazon.pool.ntp.org iburst
```
- Now restart ntp service 
```
sudo service ntp restart
```
