# Reflected XSS
- The input we provide is reflected somewhere on the page and if it's not properly filtered we can add HTML content to execute JS functions
```
<script>alert(1)</script>
```
#### Break out of javascript string and execute XSS payload
- Okay this is interesting
![[Pasted image 20220203175418.png]]
- why is there a document.write ??
- anyway, the quotes are getting escaped easily with a backslash so we can use \</script\> to exit out of the script blog of the webpage and start our own script
- The working payload: 
```
</script><script>alert("hello")</script>
```
#### Break out of encoded angle brackets
```
'-alert(1)-'
```
# Stored XSS
- The input we provide is stored somewhere on the server and is triggered only when someone views the content containing our input
