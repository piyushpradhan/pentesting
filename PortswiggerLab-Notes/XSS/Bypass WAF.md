# Bypassing WAF for XSS
## Detecting the existence of WAF
- If it's possible to inject some HTML on the webpage but something prevents \<script\> or \<input\> \<img\> etc. part to run, then there's a possibility of WAF blocking the payload execution.
- easiest solution is to use a wordlist to try all the payloads, till we get past that firewall
- XSS Cheatsheet: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet
- First capture the request which may contains XSS vulnerability 
	- Send it to Burp Intruder 
	- First check which HTML tags are valid, for that use the XSS Cheatsheet and copy all tags and use them as the payload list 
	- After finding a valid tag do something like: 
	```
	<img%20[]>
	```
	- inside the brackets add those event payloads from XSS Cheatsheet
