# Level 4
We have to get access to a webpage at http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud
**A snapshot of that EC2 instance was taken right after setting up nginx on that website**

Some instances are made public and can be accessed by everyone. To look at those instances we need to have "owner-id" and the correct "region" of that instance. 
### Finding the owner-id
```bash
aws --profile scott_flaws sts get-caller-identity
```
- It was clear from the previous level that the selected region was us-west-2

### Finding the snapshot
