# Enumeration with Kerbrute

## Enumerating users

- Displays all the user accounts on the target domain that could potentially be used to access the network.
```
./kerbrute userenum --dc <IP> -d <IP> wordlist.txt
```

## Commands: 
- **bruteuser** -> bruteforce using a single user's password from a wordlist
- **bruteforce** -> read username:password combos from a file or stdin and test them
- **passwordspray** -> test a single password against a list of users
- **userenum** -> enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos

## Flags 
- **-d** for domain
- **-dc** for domain controller
    - Atleast one of these must be set.
- **-t** - threads, set to 10 by default
- **-o** - copying output to a log file
- **-v** - include failures in the log
- **--safe** - if one account is locked then all other threads are aborted to prevent locking out of any other accounts
