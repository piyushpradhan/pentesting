# Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed database of records of all transactions or digital event that have been executed and shared among participating parties.

- Each transaction is protected through a digital signature.

### Distributed Database
- There is no Central Sever or System which keeps all the data.
- Blockchain data is distributed over millions of computers connected by Blockchain.
- This system allows Notarization of Data (data is present on every node and is publicly verifiable)

## How it works ? 
- Blockchain is essentially a Linked-List, in which a block or node depends upon all the blocks or nodes before it.
- Also, in order to change the data on the ith block user has to change all the data after the ith block, or else the blockchain will become invalid
- To add data, the user has to show some proof that can be validated, for this "hashes" are used.

### Mining a block
- Refers to the adding of the block present in the blockchain network.
- A miner selects a set of transactions from the pool of transactions and then mines the block or in other words, add it to the blockchain
- If multiple miners mine the same block at the same time, then the block with more difficultyis selected. Other block is called stale block.
- Mining usually rewards miners with blockchain currency.

## Additional information about blockchain
1. Immutable 
2. Decentralized
3. Smart Contracts: set of protocols that are executed when a certain condition is met, pretty much like programs or scripts
4. Consensus Protocols: Set of protocols that keep all the nodes in sync with each other. Prevents any single entity from controlling the whole blockchain system.
5. Hashing: The process using which data is stored in the blockchain (SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used by Bitcoin)
6. Wallet: Contains a user's private key which can be used to store/spend bitcoins on the blockchain
7. Private key: private passwords that validate a transaction.
