# Steganography 
- Technique to hide confidential information in other information.

## Criteria
1. Fidelity - the original and the modified image should not have significant differences after the confidential data is inserted. The image resulting from steganography should still be visibly unchanged, leaving observers unaware of the confidential data it contains.
2. Robustness - Hidden data should be resistent to any manipulation of the original image like changing the contrast, sharpening, rotation etc. 
3. Recovery - Hidden confidential data must be redisclosed upon recovery and retrievable for further use.

## Steganography in images
- Involves two domains : 
  1. Spatial domain - uses bit-wise methods of bit insertion and noise manipulation. The most suitable image format for this technique is the lossless type.
  2. Transform/frequency domain - involves manipulating algorithms and transforming images. This method hides the information in a more significant area of the cover image and produces better results that are not dependent on the image format.
