## ping 
- To check if connection to a remote resource is possible. 
- Usually the target is a website but it can also be a computer on your home network, to check if it is configured
correctly
- works on ICMP protocol (slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocol), works on the network layer of the OSI model 
or the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.

## traceroute 
- Diplays the path your request takes to reach the destination 
- On Windows *tracert* follows ICMP protocol same as that of ping, but on UNIX it follow UDP which can be changed
using switches on both Windows and UNIX. 
- -i switch for changing the interface

## whois
- Provides information of the owner of the domain.

## Understanding DNS 
- When a request is made to a website computer first looks up it's local cache to see if it's already got
an IP address stored for the website. If it hasn't then it will send a request to a *recursive DNS Server*.
- Many Internet Service Providers(ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers. 
- Details of a recursive DNS server is stored in router.
- This server will also maintain a cache of results for popular domains.
- If the requested website isn't stored in cache then the request will be passed on to the *root name server*
- The root name servers keep track of the DNS servers in the next level down, choosing an appropriate one to redirect 
your request to. These lower level server are called TLD (Top Level Domain) Servers.
- Top Level Domain servers are split up into extensions.
	Ex. There are separate servers for handling separate (.com, .co.uk, .org etc.) domains
- TLD servers keep track of the servers next level down - *Authoritative name servers* 
- When TLD receives a request it passes it down to the appropriate authoritative name server. 
- *Authoritative Name Servers* are used to store DNS records for domains directly.
- These are the source of information!
- When request reaches Authoritative Name Servers it'll send back relevant information which in turn will 
allow computer to connect to the IP address behind the requested domain. 

## dig 
- basic syntax -> "dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>"
- TTL (time to live) time after which the computer invalidates a cached record
- TTL is calculated in seconds.
